# CicekTanima

Implemented my own KNN with almost zero knowloedge about KNN or any AI related subject. Just read some wiki pages and start building this program with C# in my 
2nd year of college. Program takes mesurements of a flower and predict its type. This is not the proper way to do it but ı just wanted to see what could ı do.
